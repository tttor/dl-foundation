## ch 1: intro
* vs numpy for writing code for a simple one-layer feedforward network
* DL lib: 
  * have pretrained models, and 
  * support commonly used NN architectures like 
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and deep belief networks (DBNs)
* To execute the graph element, 
  we need to define the Session using `with` and run the session using `run`
* dividing the program into two separate parts, namely, 
  * definition of the computational graph and 
  * its execution
